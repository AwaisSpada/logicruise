Their work was exceptional, providing amazing results on a platform they were somewhat unfamiliar with, which utilized the Chrome CEF. Second, the work was done blazing fast, which was unexpected for the amount of work. Third, their prices beat almost everyone on the market, and for the quality of work, I wouldn't have been surprised if they charged much more. Fourth and final point, Logicruiseâ€™s timelines were unbeatable. They wanted to have meetings every day to discuss progress and make revisions as we went, which even I couldn't keep up with. If you need React development, go with Logicruise!",
